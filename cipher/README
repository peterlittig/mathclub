To create an NK23 key:
1. Run the keygen command: ./keygen
2. This will produce a key.csv file. If a file with that name already
   exists, the keygen command will exit without overwriting it.

To encrypt a plaintext file:
1. Copy a text file called plaintext.txt into the cipher directory.
2. Run the encrypt command: ./encrypt
   - Note: If the cipher directory does not contain a key.csv file, the
     encrypt command will generate a new key.csv file.

To decrypt a ciphertext file:
1. TBD.
